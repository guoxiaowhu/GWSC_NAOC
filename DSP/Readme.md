This includes filtering.

With the filter designed by us, we can filter signals s into three signals:
- s_1: ![s1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guoxiaowhu/GWSC_NAOC/main/figs/s1.png)
- s_2: ![s2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guoxiaowhu/GWSC_NAOC/main/figs/s2.png)
- s_3: ![s3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guoxiaowhu/GWSC_NAOC/main/figs/s3.png)
